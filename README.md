# Overview

This is a project that I created while trying to learn more about Rust as a programming language. It is for a simple hangman game that you can play. It has multiple words and it chooses one at random. It also shows a drawing of the hangman after every wrong guess..

Here is a link to a video of me explaining the code as well as the game itself.

# Development Environment

I used Rust programming language to create this project.

Rust is a nice programming language that is designed to make software safe as well as fast. It helps developers avoid common bugs and write efficient programs by checking for errors before the program runs. Rust is good for creating software like operating systems or even game engines.

# Future Work

A couple of things I'd like to fix or add in the future:

- I would like to add difficulty levels where you can choose how hard the words are that you have to guess.
- A good thing to add to this game is to add a scoring system as well as hints that take away from your score.
